        <h1>Alibaba in Singles Day sales clash</h1>
        <img src="img/news/alibaba.jpg">

        <p class="p-first">China's two largest internet retailers have clashed in the run-up to Singles Day, the world's
            biggest online sales day, on 11 November.</p>

        <p>
            Alibaba has been accused by its smaller rival JD.com of "forcing retailers" to promote their sales
            exclusively with its own outlet, Tmall.
            JD.com has lodged a complaint with the Chinese industry and commerce watchdog but Alibaba denies the
            allegation.
            The retail giant claims its rival is "panicking because they're losing".
            "They simply can't match our customer and merchant experience and logistical scale because Alibaba wins with
            customers and merchants as we provide a superior experience for users on our platforms," said Jim Wilkinson,
            Alibaba's senior vice president of international corporate affairs.
            The Wall Street Journal reported that a shoe retailer called Mulinsen had declined to promote JD's Singles
            Day event.
            Singles Day began in the early 1990s as a day for people not in relationships to treat themselves, in the
            spirit of Valentines Day.
            The Chinese State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has accepted the complaint and warned
            retailers "not to use malicious marketing methods to engage in competition" ahead of the event, according to
            the Xinhua news agency.
            A recent change in legislation bans online retailers limiting promotional activity by their merchants on
            other platforms.
            Last year, Alibaba recorded $9.3bn (£5.9bn) sales during the annual event, which it adopted in 2009.</p>

        <h1>Anonymous posts Ku Klux Klan alleged sympathisers list </h1>
        <img src="img/news/anonimus.jpg">

        <p class="p-first">The hackers' collective Anonymous has shared details of hundreds of alleged sympathisers of
            the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan (KKK) on the internet.</p>

        <p>
            Anonymous said the data was "a form of resistance" against racial violence.
            The KKK last year threatened to use "deadly force" against those protesting over the killing of a black
            youth in Ferguson, Missouri.
            A list of alleged KKK members published earlier in the week appears to have been fake.
            That list had incorrectly outed several US politicians as KKK members and was quickly followed by a denial
            from Anonymous's official Twitter account.
            'All sorts of errors'
            Thursday's list appears to detail social media profiles of people who had joined or "liked" KKK-related
            groups on Facebook and Google+. Many of the profiles featured racist imagery and slogans.
            Anonymous said it had collected the names over the course of the last year, using a variety of ways, from
            "interviewing expert sources" and "digital espionage" to obtaining publicly-available information.
            The group said those on the list included official members of various KKK groups "as well as their closest
            associates (most are also in other extremist hate groups)". Some were listed with their alleged aliases.</p>

        <h1>Greenpeace loses Indian registration </h1>
        <img src="img/news/greenpeace.jpg">

        <p class="p-first">Greenpeace says its charitable registration to operate in India has been revoked.</p>

        <p>
            The environmental campaign group says that the decision effectively shuts it down in India.
            The government of Narendra Modi has previously accused Greenpeace of flouting tax laws and having an
            anti-development agenda.
            The pressure group has been working in India for 14 years and employs more than 300 people.
            The BBC's correspondent in Delhi, Justin Rowlatt, says Mr Modi's government has been accused of a major
            crackdown on NGOs and charitable groups ever since he came to power in 2014.
            Greenpeace says it plans to challenge this latest decision. It follows a ruling that the organisation could
            not raise money abroad - which was itself successfully challenged.
            Interim Executive Director Vinuta Gopal said in a statement:
            "We are confident that we are on strong legal ground. We have faith in the legal process and are confident
            of overcoming this order."</p>
